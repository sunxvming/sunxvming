## <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ObNTw8Uzwy6KQ/giphy.gif" width="30px">&nbsp;About me

I am an wild programmer. I studied marketing in college and taught myself programming for half a year with an interest in technology. In early 2015, I came to Beijing with another friend. I lived in Wudaokou's basement and ate instant noodles. After a few days of resume and a few days of trial, I found a job as a web developer and began my career as a programmer. Successively engaged in web front and back end, game server and client, blockchain, etc., and focused more on server technology.
